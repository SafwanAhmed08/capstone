responses:
  utter_greet:
    - text: "Hello! I am your Smart Factory Cybersecurity Assistant. How can I help?"

  utter_goodbye:
    - text: "Stay safe! Remember to keep your IoT devices secure."

  utter_threat_detection:
    - text: "I can run anomaly detection using ML models on IoT traffic. Please specify the device or log file."

  utter_mitigation:
    - text: "Mitigation steps include isolating compromised devices, applying firmware patches, and deploying RL-based automated defenses."

  utter_device_status:
    - text: "IoT device monitoring shows normal traffic. No anomalies detected. Would you like a detailed analysis?"
